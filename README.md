# Online-Assessment-System
This is a web application which simulates the online assessment system for college students. It allows the faculty to set the problem questions that could be either objective or descriptive. For objective type questions, it matches with the correct option and awards the marks for it. For descriptive type questions, it matches the answer with the keywords provided by the faculty to award the suitable marks. The students can immediately check their marks after submitting the assessment exam. The faculty finally gets the list of students who had taken the test along with the marks. 

In summary, it automates the entire assessment exam procedure by automatic evaluation of the answers.
